1 Switch to gamelogic branch cuz Cole's dumb and uses bad branch names

2 Cd to play_jeopardy/client and npm install

3 do the same at play_jeopardy/server

4 npm start at client dir (still play_jeopardy/client)

5 Do the same at server dir

6 Client should open automatically

Note: The client will hot reload changes, the server needs to be terminated and restarted to show changes. 
The client console.logs to the browser console, server console.logs to the vscode terminal

Pushes are automatically deployed, server to heroku, client to netlify
